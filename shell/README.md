# Shell 

## Defination
A **shell** is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.  
Its primary is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window (emulator) in a GUI and then execute them.  
A **shell** is **an interface between the user and the internal parts of the operating system** (kernel). 
  
A **shell prompt**, also referred to as a command prompt is a character or set of characters at the start of the command line that indicates that the shell is ready to receive commands.  
It usually is, or ends with, a dollar sign($) for ordinary users and a pound sign(#) for the root (i.e., administrative) user.
